### Introduction

Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is essentially a physical vapor deposition (PVD) method used to create thin films, where a high-powered pulsed laser beam is focused into a vacuum chamber to hit the surface of the solid target material intended for deposition. Adjacent to the target lies the substrate, where the thin film grows.

This documentation covers the basic operation of PLD. For advanced operations such as target mounting, deposition under Ar/N₂ gas, the detail on editing the PLD routine, etc. see the advanced section (under construction).

### Substrate Mounting
1. Before mounting, ensure the substrate heater stage is clean by removing any leftover silver paste using sandpaper and a cleaning tissue.
> :warning: Before mounting, clean the substrate using the method explained in the [**Recipes**](../recipes/substrate_cleaning.md) section, or perform substrate preparation according to your own experimental requirements. :warning:
2. Apply silver paste to the stage (enough to cover the substrate backside surface) and place the substrate onto the sample stage.
3. Turn ON the Main Power of the system (1st from top): Turn ON the **CB(Circuit Breaker)2** and **CB1**.
4. Connect the **thermometer** and **heater** cable.
5. Turn ON the Heater Controller Box (2nd from top): Turn ON **Power**, and **Heater** button.
6. Turn ON the Motor Controller Box (3rd from top): Turn ON **Power**.
7. Turn ON the PC. Enter the password.

### Initialize the Motors
- On the Neocera N-PLD software:
    - Go to **Start** > **Control Panel** > **System Initialization and Motor Homing** tab > **Home all motors**
> The carousel target motor (**X**) will rotate to locate the home position, and the rotation motor (**Y**) will initialize the target rotation. The PLD routine can only be executed if the homing process is completed successfully without any failures.
    - Upon a successful homing process, the LED indicators for motors X and Y will light up both on the controller box and in the software.

### Inserting the Substrate Stage
1. Make sure the silver paste is cured and substrate is securely attached to the heater stage.
2. Make sure the stage is cool enough. :warning: :fire:
3. **Take off** the thermometer and heater cable. :warning:
4. The substrate stage is connected to an 8" CF flange.
> Prepare your hand and body position beforehand so that you can smoothly insert the flange into the chamber port.:warning:**HEAVY**:warning:
5. Align the flange with the vacuum chamber. Ensure that the flange is properly seated and that there are no obstructions.
6. Hand-tighten the screws into the flange, ensuring they are inserted in the **marked** position.
7. Using **torque wrench**, begin tightening the screws in a **crisscross** or **star pattern** to ensure even distribution of pressure.
> This helps prevent warping or uneven sealing of the flange.
8. Use the torque wrench to apply the specified torque value. Turn the wrench until you hear or feel the **click**, indicating that the desired torque has been reached.
9. Repeat this process for all screws, following the same pattern.

### Starting the PLD Chamber Evacuation Routine
1. Open the turbo molecular pump **(TMP) valve** fully (**counter-clockwise**).
2. Load the routine on the software to start pumping:
    - Go to **Start** > **Control Panel** > **PLD Execution** tab > select **Load Routine**
    - Go to **New Routine** directory > **TMP** folder > choose **Pumping 1e-7 PLD** file > **OK**.
    - Press **Start Routine** button.
    - Rough pump will start and subsequently the TMP will start spinning-up to the maximum frequency of **1kHz**.
3. Wait until the pressure reaches **10<sup>-5</sup> Torr** or less.
   > :warning: If the pressure does not reach **10<sup>-3</sup> Torr** within a few minutes, check all possible sources of leaks (e.g., unfastened coarse or vent valves, untightened window ports, etc.)

### Substrate Thermal Cleaning and Degassing
1. Connect the thermometer and heater cable.
2. Open the Neocera N-PLD software:
    - Go to **Manual Control** > **Heaters**.
    - Set the **Setpoint** to your desired degassing temperature (e.g., 350°C or 700°C) and the **Ramp Rate** to 20°C per minute. :fire:
    > The substrate stage maximum heating temperature is around 900°C.
    - Click **Start**.
3. Wait for at least 1 hour.
4. Push the **Reset Controller** button to turn off the heater or proceed to ramp the temperature (deposition with substrate heating).

### Setting the Deposition Temperature
1. If you plan to perform the deposition at a spesific temperature, you can start to ramping the substrate temperature up/down.
2. You can ramp-up/down the temperature by setting the heater controller in the software: **Manual Control** > **Heaters**
> See the [silver paste curing step](#silver-paste-curing) / [thermal cleaning step](#Substrate-Thermal-Cleaning-and-Degassing).

### Deposition Process
1. Turn ON the **Laser’s KEY** and wait for at least 5 minutes. Take note the number appear on the LED.
> Wait the water coolant to circulate.
