## Substrate Cleaning Procedure Using Organic Solvents
:material-tag-outline:{ title="Minimum version" } [1.0.0](../changelog/index.md)

### **Materials Needed**
- Acetone
- Isopropyl alcohol (IPA)
- Deionized (DI) water
- Lint-free wipes or cleanroom-grade tissue
- Ultrasonic cleaner (sonicator)
- Nitrogen (N₂) gas or clean air blower
- Clean glass beakers (for solvents)

### **Steps**

1. **Initial Setup:**
    - Ensure the ultrasonic cleaner is clean and filled with water to the recommended level.
    - Prepare two clean glass beakers: one with acetone and the other with isopropyl alcohol (IPA).

2. **Acetone Cleaning:**
    - Immerse the substrate (e.g., SiO₂/Si) in the beaker containing acetone.
    - Place the beaker into the ultrasonic cleaner (sonicator).
    - Sonicate the substrate in acetone for 5 minutes. This step helps dissolve organic contaminants and dislodge particles adhered to the surface.

3. **IPA Cleaning:**
    - After acetone cleaning, quickly transfer the substrate to the beaker containing IPA while simultaneously pouring IPA over the surface of the substrate to prevent residue from forming due to the rapid evaporation of acetone.
    - Sonicate the substrate in IPA for an additional 5 minutes. IPA helps remove any remaining acetone and further cleans the substrate.

4. **Rinsing:**
    - Carefully remove the substrate from the IPA and rinse it thoroughly with deionized (DI) water to remove any solvent residues.
    > :warning: If the quality of the DI water is not good, this step could worsen the surface. In such cases, it can be skipped. :warning:

5. **Drying:**
    - Blow-dry the substrate using nitrogen (N₂) gas or a clean air blower to prevent water spots or streaks.
    > :material-test-tube: Try experimenting with the best way to dry the substrate. You can press gently the substrate with tweezers onto clean, lint-free wipes (cleanroom-grade tissue) and then blow it dry. Alternatively, you can hold it in the air and blow it dry. :material-test-tube:
    - Ensure the substrate is completely dry before proceeding.

6. **Final Inspection:**
    - Inspect the substrate under a microscope or in a cleanroom environment to ensure it is free of any contaminants.
    - If any residues or particles remain, repeat the cleaning process as needed.

7. **Storage (if applicable):**
    - If the cleaned substrate is not used immediately, store it in the vacuum dessicator to avoid contamination.
